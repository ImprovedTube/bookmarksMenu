## Privacy Policy

The protection of your data is very important for me. Therfore I would like to inform you that I do not collect your personal information 
(e.g. usernames, passwords, browser history etc...) for any purposes when you are using BookmarksMenu.

The Extension has the access to your browser bookmarks, but they are neither collected nor transmitted to any person or services.


## Why I do not collect any personal data
The BookmarksMenu is not a commercial product and it aims:
- to create fast and easy Chrome Extension to navigate through bookmarks
- to learn native JavaScript therefore I do not use any libraries like jQuery in the project
